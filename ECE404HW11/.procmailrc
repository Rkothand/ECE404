## Recipe_3:
##
## This is an emailing recipe.  It will send to your regular
## Purdue webmail account all messages that originate from
## the purdue.edu domain and that have survived the previous
## recipes.
##
##
## IMPORTANT NOTE: The email address in the last line of the
## recipe is your Purdue webmail address --- the address on
## which you normally receive your email DO NOT put your
## special account name in that line since that would create
## an infinite loop.

## IMPORTANT: Since spammers fake their headers, a spam
## message actually coming from outside Purdue may still
## look like it is coming from Purdue.
